## Requirements
torch == 1.2.0
torchvision = 0.4.0


## Dataset: SYSU-CD ([download](https://github.com/liumency/SYSU-CD))

- The dataset contains 20000 pairs of 0.5-m aerial images of size 256Ã—256 taken between the years 2007 and 2014 in Hong Kong. 
- The main types of changes in the dataset include: (a) newly built urban buildings; (b) suburban dilation; (c) groundwork before construction; (d) change of vegetation; (e) road expansion; (f) sea construction.
